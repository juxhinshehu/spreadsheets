## Installation
`php artisan migrate`
`php artisan db:seed`

Create .env and configure the database variables

(The api keys for my google project are located in storage/config.json so no need to change anything there)

## Testing
To manually execute the syncronization of spreadsheets execute
`php artisan syncronize:spreadsheets`

Otherwise if the schedule worker is on (`php artisan schedule:work`) it will be executed daily on 00.00


## Explanation

For each sheet of a spreadsheet you can determine a target table (where the data is going to be syncronized in our db). This information is presented on the `sheet_configurations` table.

To determine the matchings of columns of the sheet and target table is used the `sheet_column_matchings` table in our db.

For our test case generated by the seeding data as target table serves the `sales` table in our db
